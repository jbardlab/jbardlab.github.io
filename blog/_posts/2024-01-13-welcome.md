Welcome, I am starting the Bard lab website! I am including some notes on how I built the website, both for my own references and to hopefully help other people who want to copy this template.

I did my postdoc with [Allan Drummond](https://drummondlab.org/team/d-allan-drummond), so my first instinct was to copy his [website](https://github.com/drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io). However, the bones of the Drummond Lab website were built with [jekeyl-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap?tab=readme-ov-file), a project that is no longer actively developed. Meanwhile, the Bedford Lab [website](https://bedford.io/), which was the original inspiration for the Drummond Lab website, was [upgraded](https://github.com/blab/blotter/commit/baa4c79b16ed0b4f6438dce12406633cf7498d4c) to Bootstrap 4. I therefore decided to start with that as my template.

To host the website on github pages (which will allow for automatic version control), I created an [organization](https://github.com/jbardlab) in github with my [personal github](https://github.com/jabard89) as the owner. 
I first made a fork of Trevor's [github](https://github.com/blab/blotter), which he generously has kept available under the MIT license. Following github pages [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), I named my project [jbardlab.github.io](https://github.com/jbardlab/jbardlab.github.io).

I downloaded a clone of the github to my computer, and then removed all of the Bedford Lab specific content. I liked the bottom navbar from the Drummond lab website, so I copied that over from the Drummond Lab default lab [template](https://github.com/drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io/blob/staging/_includes/themes/lab/default.html). Then I used chatGPT to update the navbar to Bootstrap 4.6 standards, and cleaned up the layout templates a little by separating out the pieces into separate html files in the _includes folder.

I was getting a bunch of warnings about division operations in bootstrap scss files. In order to fix them, I redownloaded bootstrap source [files](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/download/).

I modified the papers page and format to be a hybrid of the Bedford lab and Drummond lab style.

I borrowed the research template from [Premal Shah](https://github.com/shahpr/shahlab/tree/master).
