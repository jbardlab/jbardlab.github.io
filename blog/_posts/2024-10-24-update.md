I have had issues getting the ruby preview to run on multiple computers. Inspired by and directly building off of the [Greene Lab Lab Website Template](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template), I built a docker container to run the website locally.

1. Install Docker Desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Run the following command in the terminal to build the docker container:
```bash ./.docker/run.sh```
3. Wait for docker to build the container and start the server.
4. The website should be available to preview at http://localhost:4000
