I have had issues getting the ruby preview to run on multiple computers. Inspired by and directly building off of the [Greene Lab Website Template](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template), I built a docker container to run the website locally. In the process, I also made a clean break from the original Bedford lab website so that we didn't accidently try and push to it. Also, its 1700 commits were taking up 1GB of space.

1. Install Docker Desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Run the following command in the terminal to build the docker container:
```bash ./.docker/run.sh```
3. Wait for docker to build the container and start the server.
4. The website should be available to preview at http://localhost:4000
