# Design and Implementation

This site was built directly from Trevor Bedford's beautiful [site](http://bedford.io), with further modifications based on those done by Allan Drummond for the [Drummond Lab website](http://drummondlab.org). Some code was also borrowed from [Premal Shah](https://github.com/shahpr/shahlab/tree/master) and the [Greene Lab](https://github.com/greenelab/lab-website-template).

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator that converts markdown files into html. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which automatically builds the site from the source code whenever a change is pushed to the repository. Layouts are designed using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), a responsive front-end framework for web development. The site is styled using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and uses [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) for the font, [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans).

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbardlab/jbardlab.github.io). All code is placed under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, I'd appreciate [attribution](http://bardlab.org/about.html) and a link back to Trevor's [original site](http://bedford.io).
